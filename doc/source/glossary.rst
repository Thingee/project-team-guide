   Design Summit

     The 'Design Summit' is the previous name for the developer-oriented event
     that used to happen concurrently with the OpenStack Summit. Design
     Summits have been split into two separtate events: the :ref:`forum` at the
     OpenStack Summit, and the :ref:`ptg`.

   Forum

     The 'Forum' is one of the pillars of the OpenStack Summit event. It is
     where the community gets together to discuss the future of OpenStack.
     See :ref:`forum` for details.

   IRC

     Internet Relay Chat is a real-time communication platform used by
     many open source projects. See :ref:`irc-meetings` and
     :ref:`irc-channels` for details about how OpenStack uses IRC, and
     https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC for tips for setting up a
     client.

   Mid-cycle sprints

     Midcycle sprints or meetups are optional in-person gatherings
     focused around a project team or a specific initiative within the
     community. See :ref:`sprints` for details.

   Project Teams Gathering ('PTG')

     The 'Project Teams Gathering' is an event for upstream project team
     members to get together to bootstrap a new development cycle and
     organize the work for the remainder of the cycle. See :ref:`ptg`
     for details.

   PTL

     A Project Team Lead is a member of a project team elected to lead
     and represent that team for a release cycle. See
     :ref:`ptl-duties` for more details.

   TC

     The OpenStack Technical Committee is responsible for governance
     of the technical contributors to the project. See
     https://governance.openstack.org/tc/ for more details.
