Cross-Project Specifications
============================

In order to provide OpenStack end-users with a consistent and desirable
experience, it can be necessary for some concepts (e.g. quotas, backwards
compatibility) and new feature requests  to be agreed across all projects in
the big tent.

Cross-Project Specification Liaisons
====================================

OpenStack relies on the cross-project spec liaisons from each participating
project to help with coordination and cross-project spec related tasks. The
liaison defaults to the PTL, but the PTL can also delegate the responsibilities
to someone else on the team by updating the liaison list on the
CrossProjectLiaisons_ wiki page.

Liaison Responsibilities
------------------------

The liaison does not have to personally do all of these things, but must ensure
they are done by someone on the project team.

* Watch the `cross-project spec repo`_.

  * Comment on specs that involve your project. +1 to carry forward for TC
    approval.

    * If you're not able to provide technical guidance on certain specs for
       your project, it's up to you to get the right people involved.
    *  Assuming you get someone else involved, it's up to you to make sure they
       keep up with communication.

  * Communicate back to your project's meeting on certain cross-project specs
    when necessary. This is also good for the previous bullet point of sourcing
    who would have technical knowledge for certain specs.

* Attend the `cross-project meeting`_ when it's called for.
* Work with the PTL of your project to begin prioritizing implementations of
  agreed specs from the community.
